    "***\n",
    " - The overall goal of this project is to create financial models of companies that can be used for a machine learning project\n",
    " - I plan to look into approaching this from a macroeconomic view and from a quantitative analysis view\n",
    "    - To garner the macroeconomic view, I will look at Bridgewater Asscociates or Blackrock to see how this company runs and gain insight \n",
    "    - For a quantitaive analysis view, I will look towards Point 72 or DE Shaw but I am sure my opinions will waiver when I get more information and knowledge on this view\n",

    "### Macroeconomic Investing\n",
    " - To start, I plan to take notes on macroeconomics and upload them to my notes page\n",
    " - Then I would I like to leverage open data, most likely by the Bank of Canada's API to see some trends in the real world data\n",
    "    - Mainly to help with visualization and applicaton\n",
    " - This would hopefully further my knowledge into how GDP, inflation, bonds, etc. \n",
    " - Furthermore, I would then try to learn how a macroeconomics analyst would use the data to make decisions on whether to buy, sell, or hold in my position\n",
